/* Factors of a Number

Define a static utility function in a separate class that creates a collection of all the numbers that are factors of the user's number (> 1). For example, if the function is called factor, factor(36) should return {1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36}. The numbers in your list should be unique and ordered from least to greatest, and 1 and the original number should be included.
*/

/* Mean, Median, and Mode

In a set of numbers, the mean is the average, the mode is the number that occurs the most, and if you rearrange all the numbers numerically, the median is the number in the middle.

Create three static utility functions in a separate class that allow the user to find the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers. If you have access or know of functions that already complete these tasks, do not use them.

-In the mean function, give the user a way to select how many decimal places they want the answer to be rounded to.
-If there is an even number of numbers in the list, return both numbers that could be considered the median.
-If there are multiple modes, return all of them.

/* What's My Number
Between 1 and 1,000,000, there is only 1 number that meets the following criteria. Write a program to find out which number meets these criteria: 

-The number has two or more digits.
-The number is prime.
-The number does NOT contain a 0 or 1.
-The sum of all of the digits is less than or equal to 10.
-The first two digits add up to be odd.
-The second to last digit is even.
-The last digit is equal to how many digits are in the number.
