/* Factors of a Number

Define a static utility function in a separate class that creates a collection of all the numbers that are factors of the user's number (> 1). For example, if the function is called factor, factor(36) should return {1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36}. The numbers in your list should be unique and ordered from least to greatest, and 1 and the original number should be included.
